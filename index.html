            I have lived in Philadelphia for two years and love the city life. I love all things video games and television. <br><br>I have significant experience
            in the insurance industry and have held positions at Prudential Financial and Liberty Mutual Insurance. I have handled everything from administrative tasks,
            to cutting checks, to determining if people can access their benefits. I want to use my new experience I have gained through the Penn LPS Coding Bootcamp
            to transition from customer service roles to creating dynamic websites.
